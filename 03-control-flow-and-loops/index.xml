      <description>After this lesson, students will be able to:
 Use if/else conditionals to control program flow based on Boolean (true or false) tests
 Use switch/case conditionals to control program flow based on matching explicit values
 Use while and do/while loops
 Understand how loop iteration using for and forEach works

      <description>Switch Statement  Used an alternative to if..else if statements
 Evaluates an expression, and matches that expression against each of the case clauses
 if there&amp;rsquo;s a match, the statements associated with that case clause will be executed
 The break keyword must be used to exit the Switch statement after a match is found
  switch(expression) { case x: // execute code block when expression === x  break // &amp;lt;- break must be called to exit the switch statement after the match  case y: // execute code block when expression === y  break // &amp;lt;- break must be called to exit the switch statement after the match  default: // execute code block when expression === when none of the above cases match }  Example const food = &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; switch(food) { case &amp;#39;pear&amp;#39;: console.</description>

      <description>Lab: JavaScript Basics, Control Flow &amp;amp; Loops  You are tasked with completing the problem set which is hosted on Github, see the url below:
 Github Repo for JS Basics, Control Flow &amp;amp; Loops Lab  Use the &amp;ldquo;Assignment Submission Git Workflow&amp;rdquo; (instructions) to access the lab files and submit your completed assignment
  Tips  Be resourceful, leverage the class notes, google, MDN or any other means at your disposal to solve these problems (a core developer skill is being able to look things up and find the answers)</description>
