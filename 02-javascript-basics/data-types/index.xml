      <description>Strings  Strings can consist of letters and other characters
 They are surrounded by either double quotes or single quotes (this is how you recognize you are working with a string)
 Concatenation allows you to combine strings
  // declare a variable called color and store a string  let color = &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;  Single or double quotes can be used for strings, but the opening quote must match the closing quote</description>

      <description>Numbers  Used for tasks involving counting or calculating sums
 Whole numbers (integers) or decimals (floats)
 Numbers can be negative or positive
 Numbers do not have quotes around them
  There are no commas used when expressing numbers, for example the number 1,750 is expressed as 1750 in JavaScript

      <description>Booleans  Can only have a value of true or false
 true/false are special keywords in JavaScript and do not have quotes around them
  // declare a variable called isOn and assign a value of true let isOn = true // declare a variable called isWarm let isWarm // assign a value of false to isWarm isWarm = false   Booleans are useful for helping our programs make decisions (when used with conditionals, comparison &amp;amp; logical operators)</description>

      <description>Arrays  Used to when you are working with a list of values that are related to each other
 Use square brackets to create an array (this is also how you quickly recognize arrays)
 Values in an array are separated by commas
  Creating an Array  We can store variables just like any other data type
 You can create that doesn&amp;rsquo;t initially contain any values, this is called an empty array</description>

      <description>Objects  Objects are used to represent real world objects in programming
 Within an object, variables are known as properties and functions are known as methods
 Curly braces are a means of identifying if a variable is an object
  // create an object that represents a dog  let myDog = { name: &amp;#34;Fido&amp;#34;, age: 4, speak: function() { console.log(&amp;#39;Woof woof&amp;#39;) } }   In the example above, we created an object and stored it in a variable called myDog</description>
